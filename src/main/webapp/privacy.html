<h1>Privacy Policy for presheaf.com</h1>
<ul>
    <li>
        When you log in, your name is displayed in the browser.
        We do not know your name; it's never sent back to our server.
    </li>
    <li>Your Facebook Id (something like nine digits) is hashed, and the hash 
    is used on our server to locate your files. We don't know your Facebook Id.</li>
    <li>Your diagram files are available to anybody with the link. There's no privacy in these files. But the fact that a certain diagram is connected to your id is known only to you. Again, we don't know your id, we only know the hashcode, and it's irreversible. 
    We cannot restore your id from the hash.</li>
    <li>The diagram files (sources, images, pdfs) are stored in Amazon S3 storage.
    We do back up, but very rarely; if the content is dear to you, we suggest that you make a copy.</li>
</ul>

We will do our best not to store any personally-identifiable information, ever - unless you choose to post a file with your data - which fact we cannot control.
